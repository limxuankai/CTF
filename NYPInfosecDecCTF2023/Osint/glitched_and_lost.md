# Glitched and Lost

**Challenge Type: Google Maps**  

## Challenge

Just loaded into the game, everything seems weird. The game looks like its based on a real life location, but it is glitched. Flag format is NYP{Exact_Name_Of_Location_Used_By_Google_Maps}

![Glitched](glitched.png)

## Solution 

1) Look at the meta data to see the photo is in San Fransico
2) Notice the bridge? There's like 3 bridges in San Fransico, just compare it to the photo and which is the closest.
3) Notice that there is that pointy thing at the end, search for that design and you shall find that it is one of the piers
4) So just search perpendicular to it and get that as the answer.
5) Flag: NYP{Vallejo_Steps}
## P.S

5 tries? Really??? Dude, I was dying for this one...
