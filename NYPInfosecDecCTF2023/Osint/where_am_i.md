# Where am I

**Challenge Type: Github**  

## Challenge

HELP ME PLEASE...I'm stuck-in-a-videogame :'(( I don't know how to get out! గితుబ్

## Solution 

1) Translate this గితుబ్ into English to find it is github
> This is apparently tagalong
2) Search 'stuck in video game' in github to get this: ```https://github.com/ctfwhoami/stuck-in-a-videogame```
3) Going through the files, you can't find anything too suspicious so you will have to go through the various commits.
4) After ```Ctrl F NYP{```, you should eventually be able to find it as: NYP{Y0u-f0unD-m3!}
