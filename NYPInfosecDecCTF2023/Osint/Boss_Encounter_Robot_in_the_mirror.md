# Boss Encounter-The Robot In The Mirror

**Challenge Type: Youtube**  

## Challenge

You enter a dungeon room. Inside was a completely normal bed room, with a giant broze mirror in the middle. You look through the mirror, u see the background of the room you are in. However, instead of you in the mirrror, a pure white robot is instead in your place. He does not make a sound or attempt to talk, just following you actions as if you are looking into a real mirror. The only detail on him is a wierd code indented on his forehead that reads "MVZz4iWRK2f="

## Solution 

1) So we see a weird code thing that looks like base 64 and we will have to reverse it.
> For most people their obvious gut feeling is to decrpyt it to find somewhere else but remember this is osint for guess work. So me being the chronically online person, swapped the equal sign into the front and slap it onto a youtube link like this: ``` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVZz4iWRK2f```
2) You shall see some obnoxious valorant gamers playing. You will also notice a lot of base 64 code, try decrpyting all of them.
> From here on, its a test of patience for they give like 10 fake flags inside this one thing.
3) Eventually stumble into close captions and decrypt to get the final flag.
4) Flag: NYP{L1kE&sUb5cr1Be}

## P.S

DID I EVER MENTION THAT I WAS THE FIRST BLOOD PERSON TO DO IT. I AM DA BEST PERSON AND NOT CRONICALLY ONLINE
