# Running Man 

**Challenge Type: Stegography**  

## Challenge

Found an image in the data files somewhere. A funny looking man running while holding a flag. It doesn't seem to be used anywhere in the system though? Might be just a useless file.

## Solution 

1) Use ```https://www.aperisolve.com/``` to upload the file and view it in different colors. 
2) Flag: NYP{1nF053c!?}
