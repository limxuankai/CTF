[File](<dist-CashHat-The-Ripper (1).zip>)

## Solution 

1) ALRIGHT ITS YOUR FAVORITE SERIAL KILLER TIME: JOHN THE RIPPER!! First download the file
2) Eventually you will get a zip folder which is password protected
3) Using zip2john zip folder > zip.hashes, basically transfering the zip folder to be read as a hash.
4) Now you just use john zip.hashes
5) Wait for 3 months 
6) Then you get the password as '123mango'
7) Key it in to get flag: flag{W34k_P4ssw0rds_St4Nd_n0_Ch4nc3}

### P.S 

Ok so i don't know why the flag is in flag{} instead of grey{}.
